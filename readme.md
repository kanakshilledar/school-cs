## This is repo contains the program list along with solutions for my school CS record. 

These are all simple programs the whole problems are divided into some categories like:
- Python Programs
- Python with mySQL programs
<br>
Problems Done
- [x] Only Python Programs<br>
- [ ] Python + SQL Programs<br>
- [ ] SQL Queries
<br>
Whenever you see `$ ` this means that you need to input something there. Check the code for what is required to enter.

You can feel free to edit these programs. _I have commented them where ever required_

I will complete the whole list as soon as possible.

Thank You!
